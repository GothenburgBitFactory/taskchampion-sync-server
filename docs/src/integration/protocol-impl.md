# Sync Protocol Implementation

The [sync protocol](https://gothenburgbitfactory.org/taskchampion/sync.html) is
an open specification, and can be re-implemented from that specification as
desired. This specification is not battle-tested, so refer to
taskchampion-sync-server's implementation to resolve any ambiguities, and
please create pull requests to resolve the ambiguity in the specification.

We suggest that new implementations be published as open-source packages where
possible.
