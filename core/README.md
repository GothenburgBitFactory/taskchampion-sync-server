# taskchampion-sync-server-core

This crate implements the core logic of the taskchampion sync protocol.

This should be considered a reference implementation, with [the protocol
documentation](https://gothenburgbitfactory.org/taskchampion/sync-protocol.html).
representing the authoritative definition of the protocol. Other
implementations are encouraged.
